 ==== Day 1 ====

So... I decided to try #100daysofcode challange, to grow as programmer and meet new people from programming world. As I found somewhere - we are like avarage of 5 closest people. When I think about it makes sense so I'm going to change something and this challnage is kind of try of such change.
I decided to try to mix kind of flashcard app with Cat Game where player collects cats (here would collect kanjis). Such app will involve not only my programming skills but also drawing and learning Japanese.
That's quite ambitious but I want to try it.

So today:
- I made a brand new user account on Windows to not get distracted by my normal account
- of course nothing worked there (VSC, I totally messed up git...(oh! why not? eh...), at least node worked...) so I spent a few hours to make it work (and I discovered something like git portable, really handy thing) - does it count as this day completing ^^'? <- just joking
- I had to learn a few new commands in windows cmd (as they're different from linux's I know)
- I made 2 repos - this log repo and main app repo
- I made dedicated accounts: Windows user account, this github account and Twitter account @red_brigid
- I created new a React project with basic structure (hmm... maybe I should be preparing some kind of documentation? It's not going to be that simple project...). I also had idea to use Ionic with React but maybe I'll port it to Ionic one day or React native. I see a lot of offerts for React native dev but none for Ionic... is it worth to learn Ionic then? Or better invest into React native?
- I messed a but with map() but fixed - I have now nested component mapped from array
- I wonder how to properly use pictures in git... I made it work with switch but with enormous set of pictures and planned pagination it won't make sense but we shall see...
- I made scratch of documentation
- I deleted index.html, oh, why not? XD That's the achievement!

Subjects to explore:
- pictures in React

Plans for tomorrow:
- style a bit my "tower"
- make Character clickable

==== Day 2 ====

Struggling with CSS was really demotivating. And it's only 2nd day! Eh...

But it did both planned things for today:
- styling with CSS flex Tower Components to have them aligned like in original Cat Game
- making Character clickable

Subjects to explore:
- passing clicked button's data on click

Plans for tomorrow:
 - not sure if my lack of patience for CSS will be enough so I'll make this aim optional: make CSS nicer...
 - continue documentation to know what I'm going to do
 - add Quizes Component with at least 1 empty Quiz Component
 - add currency and style points bar

==== Day 3 ====

After yesterday's frustration today was better. I decided to change number of kanji on floor from 7 to 10. I considered 5, but as I'm making web version now and 10 can be easilly divided by 2 to get 5 I switched to 10.

I did all what I planned:
- I fixed CSS mess a bit, still a lot to polish but at last looking at it doesn't hurt my eyes ;)
- planned components added, empty but added
- as extra thing I added drawing of one of kanji and gradually will be adding next
- I updated documentation

==== Day 4 ====

I see I didn't write yesterday plans for today... So... I decided to prepare a templete (on the end of this file) which I'm going copy-paste XD. So plans for today... emm... I saw nice "breathing" element on Twitter by @Majin_Bue so maybe I'll try to implement something similar :D. Today I have less time for project so it will be fine I think :D.

To do:
- add breathing animation in CSS for kanji

Results:
- added planned animation

Plans for tomorrow:
- find a way to lock floor to not shrink together with animated kanji

==== Day 5 ====

I fixed Floors. THey're not breathing any longer.

Results: 
- done what planned, not much but I'm rearranging my learning a bit

Subjects to explore: learn how to learn

Plans for tomorrow:
- start states at last

==== Day 6 ====

I started today using Redux to manage app state.

Results: 
- I created store, actions, reducers and dispatcher and used them on Currency Component to increment and decrement its value (final version will be far complex, this version is for tests)

Plans for tomorrow: 
- plan states and implement them

==== Day 7 ====

Not much today but just a little is still better than nothing.
I can't concentrate today. Added more states to redux but got stupid bug but let it be for now, I'll fix tomorrow.

Results:
- added more states

Plans for tomorrow: 
- continue adding states
- fix bug in navigator in both onclicks

==== Day 8 ====

I fixed bug in nav dispatch. Problem was that I wrote onClick{dispatch(myAction())} instead of onClick{()=>dispatch(myAction())} 

Results:
- didn't add new states, need to plan them first, had hard emotionally day
- I fixed dispatch bug in nav buttons

Plans for tomorrow: 
- do plan about required states
- new states based on plan or whatever else what I'll plan in documentation if I realize I have enough states for now

==== Day 9 ====

Redux still is complex... but I'm gradually fore and more familiar with it.

Results:
- I added CharacterDetails component
- I added navigating to it with redux

Subjects to explore: 
- consider making cheat-sheet for redux - I still keep forgeting important details like imports

Plans for tomorrow: 
- get access to payload in CharacterDetails component - fix bug making payload undefined
- add Back button in CharacterDetails

==== Day 10 ====

I made a quite complex chart for redux. I hope it will help me.

Results:
- made complex redux cheatsheet chart
- didn't even touch payload or back button

Plans for tomorrow: 
- get access to payload in CharacterDetails component - fix bug making payload undefined
- add Back button in CharacterDetails

==== Day 11 ====

I figured out accessing payload in Redux.

Results: 
- I accessed payload

Plans for tomorrow: 
- add Back button in CharacterDetails
- start simple quiz
