Kanji Tower is a the application inspired by funny game called Cat Game and language learning flashcards. User starts from first floor with one character. Playing minigames like quizes, memo etc. they earn currency and can buy resourcer and in the end get new characters and floors.

Floors
On each floor is 10 characters. First character on first floor and first floor itself is unlocked by default.

Getting new characters
Player can click any unlocked character to send him/her to search new characters. She can bring back resources or new characters. Percentage of success of bringing a new friend is depended on how many decorations are on floor.
Sending character is executed after finishing quiz with at least 70% correct answers.

Character
After clicking on character it opens details of character instead of tower with possibility of going back to tower.
